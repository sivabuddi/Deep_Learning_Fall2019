# This tutorial shows how to classify cats or dogs from images. It builds an image classifier using a tf.keras.Sequential model and load data using tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator. You will get some practical experience and develop intuition for the following concepts:

# Building data input pipelines using the tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator class to efficiently work with data on disk to use with the model.
# Overfitting —How to identify and prevent it.
# Data augmentation and dropout —Key techniques to fight overfitting in computer vision tasks to incorporate into the data pipeline and image classifier model.
# This tutorial follows a basic machine learning workflow:

# Examine and understand data
# Build an input pipeline
# Build the model
# Train the model
# Test the model
# Improve the model and repeat the process

# Import packages

# Data preparation
# Format the images into appropriately pre-processed floating point tensors before feeding to the network:

# Read images from the disk.
# Decode contents of these images and convert it into proper grid format as per their RGB content.
# Convert them into floating point tensors.
# Rescale the tensors from values between 0 and 255 to values between 0 and 1, as neural networks prefer to deal with small input values.
# Fortunately, all these tasks can be done with the ImageDataGenerator class provided by tf.keras. It can read images from disk and preprocess 
# them into proper tensors. It will also set up generators that convert these images into batches of tensors—helpful when training the network.

# Overfitting
# In the plots above, the training accuracy is increasing linearly over time, whereas validation accuracy stalls around 72% in the training process. 
# Also, the difference in accuracy between training and validation accuracy is noticeable—a sign of overfitting.

# When there are a small number of training examples, the model sometimes learns from noises or unwanted details from training examples—to an extent 
# that it negatively impacts the performance of the model on new examples. This phenomenon is known as overfitting. 
# It means that the model will have a difficult time generalizing on a new dataset.

# There are multiple ways to fight overfitting in the training process. In this tutorial, you'll use data augmentation and add dropout to our model.

# Data augmentation
# Overfitting generally occurs when there are a small number of training examples. One way to fix this problem is to augment 
# the dataset so that it has a sufficient number of training examples. Data augmentation takes the approach of generating more 
# training data from existing training samples by augmenting the samples using random transformations that yield believable-looking images. 
# The goal is the model will never see the exact same picture twice during training. This helps expose the model to more aspects of the 
# data and generalize  better.

# Implement this in tf.keras using the ImageDataGenerator class. Pass different transformations to the dataset and 
# it will take care of applying it during the training process.

# Augment and visualize data
# Begin by applying random horizontal flip augmentation to the dataset and see how individual images look like after the transformation.

# Apply horizontal flip
# Pass horizontal_flip as an argument to the ImageDataGenerator class and set it to True to apply this augmentation.

# Dropout (One of the Regularazization Technique for reducing overfitting)
# Another technique to reduce overfitting is to introduce dropout to the network. It is a form of regularization that forces the weights in the network 
# to take only small values, which makes the distribution of weight values more regular and the network can reduce overfitting on small training examples.
# Dropout is one of the regularization technique used in this tutorial.

# When you apply dropout to a layer it randomly drops out (set to zero) number of output units from the applied layer during the training process.
# Dropout takes a fractional number as its input value, in the form such as 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, etc. This means dropping out 10%, 20% or 40% of the 
# output units randomly from the applied layer.

# When appling 0.1 dropout to a certain layer, it randomly kills 10% of the output units in each training epoch.

# Create a network architecture with this new dropout feature and apply it to different convolutions and fully-connected layers.

# Creating a new network with Dropouts.
# Here, you apply dropout to first and last max pool layers. Applying dropout will randomly set 20% of the neurons to zero during
# each training epoch. This helps to avoid overfitting on the training dataset.
